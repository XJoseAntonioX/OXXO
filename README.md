This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Using the CSV Upload Feature

The application now supports CSV file uploads. When you first visit the site, you'll be directed to an upload page where you can:

1. Upload a CSV file with the planogram data
2. After uploading, you'll be redirected to the main simulation page
3. The data will persist across refreshes until you click "Subir Nuevo CSV"

The CSV file should contain the following columns:
- `CB`: Product code
- `Nombre`: Product name
- `Charola`: Shelf number
- `Posicion en Charola`: Position in shelf
- `Cantidad de Frentes`: Number of facings
- Other dimensions and metadata

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
